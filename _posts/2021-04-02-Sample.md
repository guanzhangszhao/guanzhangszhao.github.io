Python codes:
```python

	a sample function

	return 3*x
```

```python
print("to boldly go")
```
```
to boldly go

In my first draft of my code, I computed the logistic sigmoid function on a list of values using:

```python
import math
def sigmoid(X):
    return [1 / (1 + math.exp(-x)) for x in X]
```

One of my peer reviewers pointed out to me that my code would be faster on large data sets and be more compatable with scientific Python libraries if I assumed that the input and output were Numpy arrays.

```python
import numpy as np
def sigmoid(X):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
```

I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion!

title: Blog Post 1- Temperature Dataset Visualization
---


In this blog post, we are going to construct some interesting visualization of the temperature dataset using the Python Plotly packages. We are also going to use sqlite3, pandas and numpy for data preprocessing.

# Create a Database
In this first section, we create a database connecting information we have at hand, namely the temperature measurements at different stations over the past 70 years, the station information, and country codes. Because the dataframes are relatively large, especially the temperature measurement dataframe, we will not access them through direct reading into the RAM, but we will manipulate them through sqlite3 package on the hard drive. We will extract only the information we need when we create plots later in this blog post.

## An Empty Database
To create a database, we first import the sqlite3 package, which is a python package that has SQL functions that allows us to manipulate dataset as if we are using SQL conveniently.


```python
import sqlite3
# The following command from sqlite3 will create a connection with our
# database, if there's no such database file in the directory, sqlite will
# create one for you.
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
```

## Reading Data into the Database
The next step is to read the data we want to use into the database we just created. To do so, we use the traditional Pandas package, but with slight modifications. Most importantly, we will read the temperature measurement dataset into the database chunk by chunk and will data cleaning.


```python
import pandas as pd
# This defines a iterator to read in data chunk by chunk with size 100000
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
```


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    A data cleaning function on the temperature measurement dataset which
    stacks the dataframe, rename relevant columns and change the temperature unit to C.
    """
    # We set the index of the dataframe using the station ID and Year column and stack the df
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    # After reseting the index this will produce a dataframe with ID, Year, Month and Temperature Measurement
    df = df.reset_index()
    # We rename the Tempertaure and Month columns
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    # Change the values in the month column to int type
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    # Change the unit of temperature measurement
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```


```python
# We now read the dataframe into the database with data clearning
for df in df_iter:
    # Clean the data
    df = prepare_df(df)
    # Read the dataframe into the sql database we created
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

We also read the country information as well as the station info data into the database.


```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```


```python
countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url)
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

    

## Inspect and Close
After we read all the dataset we need into the database, we can check they are correctly written into the database using the cursor method within the connection.


```python
# Defines a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()
# Let the cursor read the 'table' info from the database which contains the name of all the datasets in the database
cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'")
# Print the result
print(cursor.fetchall())
```

    [('temperatures',), ('stations',), ('countries',)]
    

Then we close the database connection to prevent unnecessary operations.


```python
conn.close()
```

# Data Visualization
In the second part, we will visualize the datasets using Plotly. For all plots, we tackle the problem in the two steps:

    - First,we define a query function to extract the data we need from the database we created
    - Second, we write a plot function which deals with data processing and the plotting


And for the majority part of the visualization, we will also be using the following two packages:


```python
from plotly import express as px
import numpy as np
```

## Geographic Scatter Plot of Estimated Temperature Increase

In this plot, we look at a specific country within a period time. We extract the historical data of temperature measurement in each stations, and estimate how they have changed over time use linear regression. We then plot these estimated rates of tempertaure increase on the map.

To do so, we first define the query function to pull the data we need (stations name, station locations, country name, month, year and temperature measurements) from the database:


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    A query function to pull necessary data from temp.db to create a Geo Scatter Plot of
    Estimated Temp Increase
    
    country: string, name of the country
    year_begin: int, the start year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end year of the time period
    month: int, the month whose temperature change we are going to estimate
    
    returns: a dataframe containing staion name, station latitude, longitude, country name, month
    of the measurement, year of the measurement and the measurement itself
    """
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name "COUNTRY", T.month, T.year, T.temp
    FROM Stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.`FIPS 10-4` = SUBSTRING(S.id, 1, 2)
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE T.month = {0} AND T.year >= {1} AND T.year <= {2} AND C.name = {3}
    """
    # We format the command with user supplied info
    cmd = cmd.format(month,year_begin,year_end,"\"{}\"".format(country))
    # Open the connection and read the data
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    # Return the dataframe
    return df
```

For example, if we are interested in the temperature measurements in all stations in India in January from 1980 to 2020, when we call the query function, it should produce the following result.


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

Also, before we write the plot function, because we are essentially using linear regression to estimate the temp change over years, we first define a linear regression function that can be applied to a dataframe.


```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
    # The predictor is Time
    x = data_group[["Year"]] 
    # The response is the temperature
    y = data_group["Temp"]   
    # We run the linear regression
    LR = LinearRegression()
    LR.fit(x, y)
    # And return the estimate, which is the 'a', the first coef in the LinReg model
    return round(LR.coef_[0], 5)
```

Now we define the plot function to perform data processing and plotting.


```python
# An Int to Month map so that we can create title later in the function
month_map = {1:"January",2:"February",3:"March",4:"April",5:"May",6:"June",
             7:"July",8:"August",9:"September",10:"October",11:"November",12:"December"}


def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    A function to create a geo scatter plot using plotly with estimated temp increase in a specified month
    within a given country and over a given period of time.
    
    country: string, the name of the country to plot
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end year of the tmie period
    month: int, in which month we estimate the temp change overtime
    min_obs: int, we take out all measurements at stations with no more than this number of observations in total
    **kwargs: other arguments supplied to the px.scatter_mapbox function
    
    return: a geo scatter plot with temp increase estimates created by plotly
    """
    # Extract the necessary data from the database
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    # Drop rows with no enough observations
    df = df.groupby("NAME").filter(lambda x: x.shape[0] >= min_obs)
    # Calculate the estimates
    df = df.groupby(["NAME","LATITUDE","LONGITUDE","COUNTRY","Month"], as_index=False).apply(coef)
    # Rename the columns for the estimates
    df.rename(columns = {None:"Estimated Yearly Increase (â„ƒ)"}, inplace = True)
    # Create a title for the plot
    title = "Estimate in Yearly Increase in Temperature in {0} for stations in {1} from {2} to {3}"
    title = title.format(month_map[month], country, year_begin, year_end)
    # Plot the geo scatter plot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(data_frame = df, lon = "LONGITUDE", lat = "LATITUDE", 
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (â„ƒ)",
                            hover_name= "NAME",
                            title = title,
                            **kwargs)
    # Return the plot
    return fig
```

With the above function, for example, if we want to plot the estimated time change in India from 1980 to 2020 in January at stations with at least 10 observations, we can run the following code and obtain a very nice plot.


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r
```


```python
fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)
fig.show()
fig.write_html("0.html")
```
{% include 1.0.html %}

## Cumulative Abnormally Hot Temperature Observation Proportion Over Time

In this second plot, we seek to analyze if we are seeing more abnormally hotter temperature observations over time.

We will look at this problem within each specific country in a given month and calculate the cumulative proportion of abnormally hot observations over time. If this cumulative proportion is increasing, we are seeing alarming trends of global warming.

Again, to do so, we first define a query function:


```python
def query_abnormal_temperature(countries, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    A query function to extract data from temp.db for plotting cumulative abnormal proportions
    within specified countries in a given month over time.
    
    countries: list of strs, the name of the countries to look at
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end of the time period
    month: int, the speicified month to look at anormalies
    
    return: a dataframe containing station name, country name, month, year and the tempertaure measurements
    """
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, C.name "COUNTRY", T.month, T.year, T.temp
    FROM Stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.`FIPS 10-4` = SUBSTRING(S.id, 1, 2)
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE T.year >= {0} AND T.year <= {1} AND C.name IN {2} AND T.month = {3}
    """
    # Format the command with user specified arguments
    cmd = cmd.format(year_begin,year_end,tuple(countries), month)
    # Open a connection and extract the data
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    # Return the dataframe
    return df
```

Before we proceed to the actual plotting function, we also define a auxiliary unction that calculates z-scores for us.


```python
def z_score(x):
    """
    A function to calculate the z-score of each element in a Series
    
    x: Series
    
    return: the z-score of the element in the Series
    """
    # Mean
    m = np.mean(x)
    # Standard Deviation
    s = np.std(x)
    # Return the z-score
    return (x - m)/s
```


```python
month_map = {1:"January",2:"February",3:"March",4:"April",5:"May",6:"June",
             7:"July",8:"August",9:"September",10:"October",11:"November",12:"December"}

def plot_abnormal_props(countries, year_begin, year_end, month, **kwargs):
    """
    A function to create a line plot using plotly with cum abnormal observation proportions in a specified month
    within a given list of countries and over a given period of time.
    
    country: list of strings, the name sof the country to plot
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end year of the tmie period
    month: int, in which month we look for anormalies
    **kwargs: other arguments supplied to the px.line function
    
    return: a line plot with  cum abnormal observation proportions created by plotly
    """
    # Extract the necessary data
    df = query_abnormal_temperature(countries, year_begin, year_end, month)
    # Calculate the z-score
    df["z"] = df.groupby(["COUNTRY","NAME"])["Temp"].transform(z_score)
    # Find the abnormally hot obvervations
    df["Abnormal"]= df["z"] >= 2
    # Calculate the totla number of observations in a given country in a given year in the speicified month
    df["Observations"] = df.groupby(["COUNTRY","Year"])["NAME"].transform(lambda x: x.shape[0])
    # Count the abnormal observations in that month
    df["AbCount"] = df.groupby(["COUNTRY","Year"])["Abnormal"].transform(np.nansum)
    # Drop other columns no longer useful
    de = df.drop(["Temp","Abnormal","z","NAME","Month"],axis = 1)
    # Drop duplicates that were not got rid of by transform()
    de.drop_duplicates(keep = "first", inplace = True)
    # Sort the values according to Country names and the Year number
    de = de.sort_values(by = ['COUNTRY', 'Year'])
    # Calculate the Cumulative number of observations
    de["CumOb"] = de.groupby(["COUNTRY"])["Observations"].transform(np.nancumsum)
    # Calculate the Cumulative number of abnormal observations
    de["CumAb"] = de.groupby(["COUNTRY"])["AbCount"].transform(np.nancumsum)
    # Find the Cumulative proportions
    de["Prop"] = de["CumAb"]/de["CumOb"]
    # Create the title
    title = f"Cumulative Proportion of Abnormally Hot Tempertaure Observations in {month_map[month]} in Selected Countries from {year_begin} to {year_end}"
    # Plot the line plot grouped by countries
    fig = px.line(de, line_group = "COUNTRY",title = title, color = "COUNTRY", x = "Year", y = "Prop", **kwargs)
    # Return the plot
    return fig
```

With the above defined function, if we are interested in the proportional in China, Russia, Canada, United States, Australia and Poland all together in January from 1970 to 2020, we can easily plot those using the following command. And based on the plot, we are indeed seeting alarming trends of global warming in the majority of these countries.


```python
plot_abnormal_props(["China","Russia","Canada","United States","Australia","Poland"], 1970, 2020, 1)
```
{% include 1.1.html %}



## Temperature Change Over Time in Different Countries

We would also like to consider if global warming is affecting the majority of the countries in the world and how differently it has affected different countries.

To do so, we look at the change of average temperature in different countries in a specified month before and after a period of time. And we will plot these temperature changes on a geo map. To make the average more accurate, we allow the user to calculate the average temperature using multiple neighboring years.

Again, we define out query function first:


```python
def query_lagged_time_difference(year_begin, year_end, lag, month):
    """
    A query function to extract data from temp.db for plotting temp change over time
    within specified countries in a given month.
    
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end of the time period
    lag: the number of neighboring years used to calculate the average tempertaure
    month: int, the speicified month to look at temperature change
    
    return: two dataframes, one of the beginning year, the other of the end year,
    each containing station name, country name, month, year and the tempertaure measurements
    """
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, C.name "COUNTRY", T.month, T.year, T.temp
    FROM Stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.`FIPS 10-4` = SUBSTRING(S.id, 1, 2)
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE T.year >= {0} AND T.year < {1} AND T.month = {2}
    """
    # We format a command for the beginning year and the end year seperately
    cmd1 = cmd.format(year_begin - lag/2, year_begin + lag/2, month)
    cmd2 = cmd.format(year_end - lag/2, year_end + lag/2, month)
    # Open a connection and read the data
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd1, conn)
    de = pd.read_sql_query(cmd2, conn)
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    # Return the dataframes
    return df,de
```

For the expressive purpose of the plot, we will drop negative changes in the later plotting process, so we hereby define a auxiliary function to help drop those changes. These countries will appear not colored in the plot produced.


```python
def drop_neg(df):
    try:
        if (df["Difference"] <= 0).any():
            df["Difference"] = np.NaN
        return df
    except TypeError:
        return df
```

Also, to create a geo plot with countries' boundaries, we need to use the geojson file of countries to extract their coordinates. We download and store the file using urllib and json packages.


```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)
```

Finally, we define the plotting function.


```python
def plot_temp_change(year_begin, year_end, lag, month):
    """
    A function to create a geo plot using plotly with observed averaged temp change in a specified month
    over a given period of time.
    
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end year of the tmie period
    month: int, in which month we look for anormalies
    lag: the number of neighboring years to calculate the average temperature
    
    return: a geo plot with observed temp change over time created by plotly
    """
    # Extract the necessary data from temp.db
    df, de = query_lagged_time_difference(year_begin, year_end, lag, month)
    # Calculate the observed temperature in the starting period as well as the end period
    df = df.groupby(["COUNTRY"]).apply(lambda x: np.nanmean(x["Temp"])).reset_index()
    de = de.groupby(["COUNTRY"]).apply(lambda x: np.nanmean(x["Temp"])).reset_index()
    # Combine the dataframe and calculate the difference
    dp = df.merge(de, on = "COUNTRY", how = "left").rename(columns = {"0_x":"Before", "0_y": "After"})
    dp["Difference"] = dp["After"] - dp["Before"]
    # Drop the rows with negative changes
    dp = dp.groupby("COUNTRY").apply(drop_neg)
    # Create a title
    title = f"Change in Average Temperature in {month_map[month]} between {year_begin} and {year_end} measured in {lag} year average"
    # Make the plot
    fig = px.choropleth(dp, 
                        geojson=countries_gj,
                        locations = "COUNTRY",
                        locationmode = "country names",
                        title = title,
                        color = "Difference", 
                        color_continuous_scale = "Reds",
                        height = 300)
    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    # Return the plot
    return fig
```

With the defined function, we can easily plot the effect of global warming on all countries from 1950 to 2000, looking at average temperature change in January.


```python
plot_temp_change(1950, 2000, 5, 1)
```

## Temperature Deviation Over Time

*This last figure is largely experimental, I'm still working on how to make the deviation more clear depicted and what better measurements can be used.*

Over time, we are interested in how many countries all together in a given year have an increase of average temperature compared to years before.

To answer the question, we create an animated scatter plot of countries' deviation from average temperature in the past years. The plot will be animatedly constructed each year.

Again, we first create a query function.


```python
def temp_change_overtime(year_begin, year_end,  month):
    """
    A query function to extract data from temp.db for plotting temp deviation over time
    for all countries in a given month.
    
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end of the time period
    month: int, the speicified month to look at temperature deviation
    
    return: a dataframe containing stations names, country names, years and temperature measurements
    """
    cmd = \
    """
    SELECT S.name, C.name "COUNTRY", T.year, T.temp
    FROM Stations S
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.`FIPS 10-4` = SUBSTRING(S.id, 1, 2)
    LEFT JOIN temperatures T ON T.id = S.id
    WHERE T.year >= {0} AND T.year <= {1} AND T.month = {2}
    """
    # Format the command with user specified arguments
    cmd = cmd.format(year_begin, year_end, month)
    # Open a connection and read the data
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    # Return the dataframe
    return df
```

We also need to define an auxiliary function that helps us to calculate the average temperature in the past specified number of years, which can be simply achieved building from the roll method in numpy.


```python
def lag(x, num_places):
    """
    Shifts the array x by num_places positions to the right,
    Fills positions now empty with np.nan values,
    Returns the shifted array.
    
    arguments:
    x -> 1d array of float types
    num_places -> int type, number of positions to shift the array
    
    return:
    y -> 1d array after the shift
    """
    # Shift the array by num_places positions
    new = np.roll(x, num_places)
    # Fill the emptied positions with np.nan
    new[0:num_places] = np.nan
    # Return the shifted array
    return new
```

Finally, we define the plotting function.


```python
def temp_change_animated(year_begin, year_end, month, i, **kwargs):
    """
    A function to create an animated scatter plot using plotly with observed temperature deviation from average
    in a specified month over a given period of time.
    
    year_begin: int, the beginning year of the time period
    year_end: int, the end year of the tmie period
    i: int, how many years of data befor a specific year we use to calculate the benchmark average temperature
    **kwargs: other arguments supplied to px.scatter
    
    return: an animated scatter plot created by plotly over a given period of time
    """
    # Extract the data
    df = temp_change_overtime(year_begin, year_end, month)
    # Caculate the average temp in a country in a given year
    de = df.groupby(["COUNTRY","Year"]).apply(lambda x: np.nanmean(x["Temp"])).reset_index()
    de = de.rename(columns = {0:"Temp"})
    de = de.sort_values(by = ['Year', 'COUNTRY'])
    # Extend the dataframe to include all i years' temperature in a ow
    for j in range(1, 1+i):
        de["lag" + str(j)] = de.groupby(["COUNTRY"])["Temp"].transform(lambda x: lag(x, j))
    # Calculate the benchmark average temperature
    col = de.loc[: , "lag1":"lag{0}".format(i)]
    de["PastAve"] = col.mean(skipna = True, axis = 1)
    de = de[["COUNTRY","Year","Temp","PastAve"]].dropna()
    # Calculate the deviation, 1 suggests no deviation
    de["Deviation"] = de["Temp"]/de["PastAve"]
    # Create the plot
    fig = px.scatter(de, x="Temp", y="Deviation", animation_frame="Year", animation_group="COUNTRY",
                     hover_name="COUNTRY", **kwargs)
    # Add a benchmark line where y = 1
    fig.add_shape(type='line',
                x0=15,
                y0=1,
                x1=30,
                y1=1,
                line=dict(color='Red',),
                xref='x',
                yref='y')
    # Return the fig
    return fig
```

We can use the defined function to spot deviation in temperatures easily. And in the following graph, though not too significant, we constantly see the majority of the points lying above the benchmark 1.


```python
temp_change_animated(1950,2020,1,5, range_x = [15,30], range_y = [0.5,1.5])
```

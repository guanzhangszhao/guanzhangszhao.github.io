Hello! I'm Guanzhang Zhao. I also go by Simon.

I'm a second Math/Econ and Political Science students at UCLA. This quarter, I'm taking PIC 16B, Math 182, Math 131B, Econ 106M, Econ 143 and PolSci 163C. I'm also reading 115A Lecture 1&2 for the Math department.

My preliminary focus has been quantitative approach towards social problems and policy decisions. I'm also interested in financial market analysis. My PIC16B project for this quarter will be about machine learning in financial engineering. Please talk to me if you are interested!

P.S. Perhaps you have already recognized from the icon on the website, I'm currently a UmaMusume(ウマ娘) fan. My first pick is Tokai Teio(トウカイテイオー).
